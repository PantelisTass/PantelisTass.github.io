excerpt: 'We show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the law of the spatial increments (with endpoints away from the origin) of inhomogeneous Brownian last passage percolation (LPP) with non-decreasing initial data against the Wiener measure \(\mu\) on compacts is in \(L^{\infty-}(\mu)\); and for any fixed \(p>1\), the \(L^p\) norm is at most of the order \(O_p(\mathrm{e}^{d_pm^2\log m})\) for some \(p\)-dependent constant \(d_p>0\). Furthermore, when the initial data is homogeneous, we establish optimal growth on \(L^p\) norms (\(\asymp O(\exp(dm^2))\) of the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the Brownian LPP (i.e. top line of an \(m\)-level Dyson Brownian motion) away from the origin, as the number of curves \(m\) tends to infinity, for all \(p>1\) sufficiently large. As an application of our framework, we show that the Radon-Nikodym derivative of certain toy models for the KPZ fixed point lies in \(L^{\infty-}(\mu)\), inspired by its variational characterisation in terms of the directed landscape.'

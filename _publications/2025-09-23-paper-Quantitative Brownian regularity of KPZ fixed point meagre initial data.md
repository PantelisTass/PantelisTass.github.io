excerpt: 'We show that the spatial increments of the KPZ fixed point starting from initial data that is locally bounded and whose support admits \epsilon-coverings with moderate growth, exhibit strong quantitative comparison against rate two Brownian motion on compacts. The above estimates are uniform on the L^p norms, the compact set containing the support of the initial data and the length of the interval considered.'

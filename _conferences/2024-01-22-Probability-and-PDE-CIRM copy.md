title: "PDE & Probability in Interaction: Functional Inequalities, Optimal Transport and Particle Systems"
collection: conferences
type: CIRM
permalink: /classes/2024-01-22-probability-and-pde-cirm
venue: "CIRM"
location: "Marseille, France"
date: 2024-10-22
excerpt: "Several structural equations from physics describe systems composed of a large number of interacting particles. These equations play a role in kinetic theory, population dynamics, economics, and more. The conference focuses on mathematical investigation of particle systems, functional inequalities, and optimal transport. The goal is to foster contacts between specialists in probability and PDEs to develop new methods and applications."

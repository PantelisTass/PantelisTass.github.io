I supervised third year undergraduates in the Part II courses 'Stochastic Financial Models' and 'Applied Probability' during Michaelmas 2024 and Lent 2025 respectively. I had the responsibility of discussing students' submissions to problem sets (can be found <a href = "https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/II/FinancialModels/">here</a>) and more general questions regarding the material.
